SRC Repair is a free tool that can be used for tuning & restoring Steam and all Source engine games. You can also create and edit .cfg files (configs), backup game or Steam settings, and apply your FPS-config or spray into game. SRC Repair does not needs any configuration to work.

Before using, please, read official Wiki: http://code.google.com/p/srcrepair/wiki/MainPage_en (hosted on Google Code).

You can join official SRC Repair group at Steam Community: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcrepair. You will get info about fresh updates as soon as they released.

Before using it is strongly recommended to manually make backup of Steam folder and Steam registry keys (with the help of tool on "Backups" tab).
